# ðŸ¦™Llama Pack Core
![Node CI Status](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/llama-pack/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)

Llama Pack Core is a NodeJS library that helps developers to create a Project for an Android
application that launches an existing Progressive Web App (PWA) using a
[Trusted Web Activity (TWA)](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/using-twa).

**Important:** llama-pack is still under active development. The tool hasn't been tested on a wide
range of Web APKs, and bootstraping a new project may fail in those cases. Please, file issues,
feature requests, and contribute with pull requests, if possible.

## Requirements
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 10.0 or above

## Setting up the Environment

### Get the Java Development Kit (JDK) 8.
The Android Command line tools requires the correct version of the JDK to run. To prevent version
conflicts with a JDK version that is already installed, llama-pack uses a JDK that can unzipped in
a separate folder.

Download a version of JDK 8 that is compatible with your OS from
[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)
and extract it in its own folder.

**Warning:** Using a version lower than 8 will make it impossible to compile the project and higher
versions are incompatible with the Android command line tools.

### Get the Android command line tools
Download a version of Android command line tools that is compatible with your OS from
[https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools).
Create a folder and extract the downloaded file into it.

## Using llama-pack-core in a NodeJs project

```shell
npm i -g @llama-pack/core
```
